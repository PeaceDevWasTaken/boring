        <p>
            'To be or not to be' is probably the best-known line from all drama. Certainly, if anyone is asked to quote a line of Shakespeare then this is the one that first comes to mind for most people. It is from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, 1602 (Shakespeare's actual title is - The tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke)
